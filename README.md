Getting an overview of facility counts by state:

Bringing in 2018 population data, notice the similarity, but also differnce:

The linear correlation coefficient (r) between population and state facility count = 0.832893,
which is a relatively strong positive correlation.

Does the number of facilities, though, keep up with the population size? What are the statewide facility counts per capita?

Maine, Alaska, Vermont ... good job:

Some states with a lot of facilities, like California and Florida, come in the bottom ten for number of facilities per population:
