# Geographic Breakdown of Mental Health Services for At-Risk Groups in the U.S.

An analysis of the services provided by mental health care facilities across the country, including a focus on California's provision of services to at-risk demographics


### Project Goals
- Provide areas for improve at-risk groups 

### Motivation
- [Shortages](http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/cbhsq-reports/NMHSS-2018.pdf) of beds designated for mental health treatment in psychiatric and general hospitals 
- More than 60 percent of young adults in 2018 who had AMI (Any Mental Illness) [did not receive](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/crunker99/U.S.-Mental-Health-Facilities/blob/master/data/NSDUHNationalFindingsReport2018.pdf) mental health services in the past year


## EDA

 #### Data for this project primarily comes from  [National Mental Health Services Surveys](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/national-mental-health-services-survey-n-mhss-nid13521) (N-MHSS), and contains information about mental health treatment facilities in the United States.

- Original Datasets
    * 2010 - 2018 (no data available on 2011, 2013) (7 tables total)
    * 42,747 facilities (rows) with 284 features (columns)
- Data Cleaning
    * Correct for naming differences in features with the same meaning across time
    * After EDA, focused time range to 2018, most recently available data
    * Create "services count" column that sums number of facility services, remove invalid responses
- Cleaned Data
    * 11,679 facilities with 20 features



#### Focus on 2018 (most recent data at time of project)

Broad overview of facility counts by state compared to population:

![Facilities by state](images/facByState.jpeg)


![Population by state](images/popByState.jpeg)
Populalation data from [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-kits/2018/pop-estimates-national-state.html)

Linear correlation (state pop. to # of facilities) = 0.83

Does the total facilities in a state 'keep up' with its population size? (Note: This metric may be slightly naive, as facility capacity can greatly vary)

![Fac per capita map](images/facPerCapitaByState.jpeg)

States with lower [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population_density), such as Maine (46th by population denisty), Alaska (50th), and Vermont (31st) score higher. Some states have many facilities total, such as California and Florida, but they score in the bottom ten by this ratio.

In 2018, 60% of facilities operated in an 'outpatient' setting.

## At-risk groups and treatment availability 

This project examined the availability of services to at-risk groups, including children, the elderly, members of the LGBT community, and veterans. 

#### Children

## Comparison of CA to USA


The 2018 N-MHSS [survey](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/crunker99/U.S.-Mental-Health-Facilities/blob/master/data/NMHSS2018DS0001infoquestionnairespecs.pdf) requested each facility  report whether they offered dedicated services for demographics who could have greater risks associated with lack of mental health treatment than the general population. This included children/adolescents with serious emotional disturbances, persons with a diagnosis of PTSD, veterans, LGBT clients, persons with Alzheimerâ€™s or dementia, and more.



In the USA, the highest 'score' for count of services was 17. In CA, it was 14.
Looking across the mean score of all the facilities in each state:

![mean score map](images/mean_score_map.jpeg)

Lowest mean score: Iowa - 2.58
Highest mean score: Hawaii - 5.0

Overall USA mean score: 3.64
CA mean score: 3.86

The distribution is right skewed:

California facilities scores slightly better, but is the 0.22 difference in average number of services offered?

## Hypothesis Test

>*H<sub>0</sub>*: There is no signficant difference between the mean number of services for at-risk groups offered at mental health treatment facilities in California and the rest of the country.

>P(# of services at facility in CA > # of services at facility elsewhere) = 0.5

Alternate hypothesis: The mean number of services offered at mental health treatment facilities in California is significantly greater than the rest of the country.


|# fac. in USA (excluding CA)|# of facilities in CA|
|:---:|:---:|
|10829|850|


Scale the frequency counts to the rate they occur in each sample.

### Outcome
As the data was not normally distributed, a Mann-Whitney U-statistic to test the validity of the null hypothesis within a confidence interval of 95%.

**P-value = 0.000000221**

As the P-value < 0.05, we may **reject** the null hypothesis within the accepted range of type 1 error, using the Mann-Whitney U-test. 

## Further Steps

Use other categorical variables besides state and examine their influence on what types of services facilities provide.
